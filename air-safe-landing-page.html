            <h4>
              Although we don't realise it, the air is the
              <u>largest surface in any building</u> and must be cleaned, like
              any other surface in the building. Our AirSafe filters
              efficiently, quickly, &amp; cost effectively make our air safe.
            </h4>
            <h5>
              AirSafe’s ability to capture and hold particles the size of all
              known airborne pathogens is a true breakthrough in filtration. It
              greatly improves our ability to contain the spread of all
              respiratory viruses, such as seasonal cold and flu and airborne
              bacterial infections
            </h5>
            <p>
              Available for the first time ever to residential clients, our
              filters scrub sub-micron sized airborne respiratory viruses from
              the air. After AirSafe has been installed on your fan (which you
              can buy online from Amazon), the very high efficiency filtration
              can reduce airborne particles in a room by up to 93% in 3 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual time will vary with the power of your fan. But even
              with a smaller fan which takes longer, the air will still be
              cleaned. We can give you suggestions for which fans to buy,
              depending on the size of your rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              AirSafe truly is a breakthrough in creating healthy indoor air.
              It’s like putting a safety mask on your home.
            </p>
            <h5>How is AirSafe Different?</h5>
            <p>
              AirSafe is a synthetic electrostatic filter that has efficiencies
              higher than HEPA, 99.9998% @.1 micron. It is a soft flexible pad
              with a low static pressure. This allows for HEPA or near HEPA
              filtration of the air, which is the same standard used by hospital
              operating theatres.
            </p>

            <p>
              It also means that the air in all your rooms can be filtered
              without the huge costs of rebuilding your AC units. By attaching
              an AirSafe filter to a free-standing fan you will capture any
              microbe that is floating in the air. Just move the fan from room
              to room to keep the air safe and clean.
            </p>

            <p>
              AirSafe will change the lives of any immune-compromised patients,
              oncology patients, infants, and the elderly by drastically
              reducing the risk that they might come into contact with a
              dangerous submicron particle.
            </p>

            <h5>Why do I need such High Filtration?</h5>
            <p>
              You can see on this chart how small virus and bacteria particles
              are. But in this part of the world, it’s not just the sub-micron
              particles that are dangerous. Very fine dust, called “permanently
              suspended particles” are also a danger, because they build up in
              the lungs. And ultra-fine dust is disturbed very time you wipe a
              surface, because the dust becomes airborne again for a time.
              AirSafe captures ALL these airborne contaminants whenever you
              switch on your fan.
